Everyone to is welcome and safe here. If you ever feel unsafe, harassed, discouraged, attacked, or unwelcome because of someone else's actions, that's not okay.

Regardless of intent, I will always do my best to recognize, support, and address these situations when they arise. I may also actively encourage you to recognize when your actions might be contributing to a negative environment in a good faith effort to prevent misunderstandings from escalating.
